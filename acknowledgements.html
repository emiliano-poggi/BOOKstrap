## Aacknowledgements

**BOOKstrap** is a minimum-effort web site starter kit based on various resources freely available from the web. 

**BOOKstrap** web site sources are built according to **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** structure requirements so that you can take advantage of Jekyll and **[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/)** at the same time.

**BOOKstrap v1.0** web layout is currently based on [Boostrap 3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/).

**BOOKstrap** table of contents (the toggling sidebar) was implemented following the [Bootstrap sidebar tutorial](https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar) published by https://bootstrapious.com.
