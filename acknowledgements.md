## Aacknowledgements

BOOKstrap is a minimum-effort web site starter kit based on various resources freely available from the web:

* Web site sources are built according to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) structure requirements so that you can take advantage of Jekyll and [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) features at the same time.

* Web layout is currently based on [Boostrap 3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/).

* Table of contents (the toggling sidebar) was implemented following the [Bootstrap sidebar tutorial](https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar) published by https://bootstrapious.com.
